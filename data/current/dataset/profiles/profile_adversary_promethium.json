The group has conducted operations globally with a heavy emphasis on Turkish targets. [PROMETHIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0056) has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called [NEODYMIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0055) due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics.(Citation: Microsoft NEODYMIUM Dec 2016)(Citation: Microsoft SIR Vol 21)(Citation: Talos Promethium June 2020)"
