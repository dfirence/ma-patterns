    "description": "[NOKKI](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0353) is a modular remote access tool. The earliest observed attack using [NOKKI](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0353) was in January 2018. [NOKKI](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0353) has significant code overlap with the [KONNI](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0356) malware family. There is some evidence potentially linking [NOKKI](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0353) to [APT37](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067).(Citation: Unit 42 NOKKI Sept 2018)(Citation: Unit 42 Nokki Oct 2018)"
