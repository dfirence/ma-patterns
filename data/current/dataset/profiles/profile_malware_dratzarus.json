    "description": "[DRATzarus](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0694) is a remote access tool (RAT) that has been used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) to target the defense and aerospace organizations globally since at least summer 2020. [DRATzarus](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0694) shares similarities with [Bankshot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0239), which was used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) in 2017 to target the Turkish financial sector.(Citation: ClearSky Lazarus Aug 2020)"
