    "description": "[Tomiris](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0671) is a backdoor written in Go that continuously queries its C2 server for executables to download and execute on a victim system. It was first reported in September 2021 during an investigation of a successful DNS hijacking campaign against a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) member. Security researchers assess there are similarities between [Tomiris](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0671) and [GoldMax](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0588).(Citation: Kaspersky Tomiris Sep 2021)"
