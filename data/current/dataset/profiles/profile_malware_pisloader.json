    "description": "[Pisloader](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0124) is a malware family that is notable due to its use of DNS as a C2 protocol as well as its use of anti-analysis tactics. It has been used by [APT18](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0026) and is similar to another malware family, [HTTPBrowser](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0070), that has been used by the group.
