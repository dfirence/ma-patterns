    "description": "[Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) is a Russian-based threat group that has infected victims in over 45 countries, spanning a range of industries including government, embassies, military, education, research and pharmaceutical companies since 2004. Heightened activity was seen in mid-2015. [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) is known for conducting watering hole and spearphishing campaigns and leveraging in-house tools and malware. [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010)â€™s espionage platform is mainly used against Windows machines, but has also been seen used against macOS and Linux machines.(Citation: Kaspersky Turla)(Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)(Citation: CrowdStrike VENOMOUS BEAR)(Citation: ESET Turla Mosquito Jan 2018)"
