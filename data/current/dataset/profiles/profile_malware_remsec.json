    "description": "[Remsec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0125) is a modular backdoor that has been used by [Strider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0041) and appears to have been designed primarily for espionage purposes. Many of its modules are written in Lua. (Citation: Symantec Strider Blog)"
