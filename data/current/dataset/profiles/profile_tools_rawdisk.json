    "description": "[RawDisk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364) is a legitimate commercial driver from the EldoS Corporation that is used for interacting with files, disks, and partitions. The driver allows for direct modification of data on a local computer's hard drive. In some cases, the tool can enact these raw disk modifications from user-mode processes, circumventing Windows operating system security features.(Citation: EldoS RawDisk ITpro)(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)"
