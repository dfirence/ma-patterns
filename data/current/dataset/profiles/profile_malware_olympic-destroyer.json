    "description": "[Olympic Destroyer](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0365) is malware that was used by [Sandworm Team](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034) against the 2018 Winter Olympics, held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The main purpose of the malware was to render infected computer systems inoperable. The malware leverages various native Windows utilities and API calls to carry out its destructive tasks. [Olympic Destroyer](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0365) has worm-like features to spread itself across a computer network in order to maximize its destructive impact.(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)(Citation: US District Court Indictment GRU Unit 74455 October 2020) "
