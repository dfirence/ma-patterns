    "description": "[Xbash](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0341) is a malware family that has targeted Linux and Microsoft Windows servers. The malware has been tied to the Iron Group, a threat actor group known for previous ransomware attacks. [Xbash](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0341) was developed in Python and then converted into a self-contained Linux ELF executable by using PyInstaller.(Citation: Unit42 Xbash Sept 2018)"
