    "description": "[Winnti for Linux](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0430) is a trojan, seen since at least 2015, designed specifically for targeting Linux systems. Reporting indicates the winnti malware family is shared across a number of actors including [Winnti Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044). The Windows variant is tracked separately under [Winnti for Windows](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0141).(Citation: Chronicle Winnti for Linux May 2019)"
