The [MiniDuke](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0051) toolset consists of multiple downloader and backdoor components. The loader has been used with other [MiniDuke](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0051) components as well as in conjunction with [CosmicDuke](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0050) and [PinchDuke](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0048).
