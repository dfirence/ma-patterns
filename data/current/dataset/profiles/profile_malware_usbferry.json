    "description": "[USBferry](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0452) is an information stealing malware and has been used by [Tropic Trooper](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0081) in targeted attacks against Taiwanese and Philippine air-gapped military environments. [USBferry](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0452) shares an overlapping codebase with [YAHOYAH](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0388), though it has several features which makes it a distinct piece of malware.(Citation: TrendMicro Tropic Trooper May 2020)"
