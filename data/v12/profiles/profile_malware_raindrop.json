    "description": "[Raindrop](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0565) is a loader used by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) that was discovered on some victim machines during investigations related to the 2020 SolarWinds cyber intrusion. It was discovered in January 2021 and was likely used since at least May 2020.(Citation: Symantec RAINDROP January 2021)(Citation: Microsoft Deep Dive Solorigate January 2021)"
