    "description": "[Sibot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0589) is dual-purpose malware written in VBScript designed to achieve persistence on a compromised system as well as download and execute additional payloads. Microsoft discovered three [Sibot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0589) variants in early 2021 during its investigation of [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) and the SolarWinds cyber intrusion campaign.(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)"
