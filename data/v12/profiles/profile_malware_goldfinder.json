It can be used to inform  threat actors of potential points of discovery or logging of their actions, including C2 related to other malware. [GoldFinder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0597) was discovered in early 2021 during an investigation into the SolarWinds cyber intrusion by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016).(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)"
